## Bearer Token Security Model

NATS supports two authentication modes for users:

### Standard Mode (bearer = false, default)
- **Two-factor authentication**: Client needs both JWT (public) and private key (seed)
- Client must sign a challenge to prove key ownership
- JWT can be safely exposed in logs and outputs (not a secret)
- Use the `jwt` attribute to access the token

### Bearer Mode (bearer = true)
- **Single-factor authentication**: JWT alone grants access (like an API key)
- No signature verification required
- **JWT becomes a secret credential** - must be protected
- Use the `jwt_sensitive` attribute (marked as sensitive in Terraform)

## JWT Output Attributes

The resource provides two JWT output attributes:

- **`jwt`**: Only populated when `bearer = false`. Safe to use in logs and outputs since the JWT is not a secret in standard mode.
- **`jwt_sensitive`**: Always populated, marked as Terraform sensitive. Use this for bearer tokens to prevent accidental exposure in logs.

**Important**: When `bearer = true`, the `jwt` attribute will be null. Always use `jwt_sensitive` for bearer tokens.
